# selfdestruct
force sending ether from one contract to another one

Since the contract has no actual code to it, we can't send it ether using the normal method.
Thing is though...When a contract self destructs, it force sends the ether to another address you give it and even if there is no code in there, it has to send it, otherwise where does that ether go?
My question is, if the contract uses a workaround to this then where would the ether go? But I guess no one will say no to free eth :)
